## 📄 Idea2Paper

Idea2Paper is an end-to-end research agent framework that aims to systematically define and analyze the major stages of the contemporary research process, along with the core challenges inherent to each stage. Rather than treating paper writing as a monolithic generation problem, Idea2Paper explicitly decomposes scientific research into structured phases and identifies critical bottlenecks that hinder the transformation of raw ideas into coherent, submission-ready academic narratives. Through this analysis, Idea2Paper highlights that one of the most fundamental yet underexplored challenges lies in research paradigm generation—the process of converting an underspecified research idea into a logically consistent, academically grounded research story. Existing systems often struggle to produce stable and reusable research paradigms, especially when reasoning is performed entirely at runtime and under limited contextual grounding.

To address these challenges in a principled and engineering-oriented manner, Idea2Paper adopts a modular system design. Instead of immediately building a fully end-to-end writing system, the project prioritizes the construction of targeted engineering submodules that tackle specific bottlenecks in the research pipeline. As the first and core engineering submodule, Idea2Story is introduced to directly address the problem of research paradigm generation. Idea2Story focuses on transforming underspecified research ideas into complete, coherent, and submission-ready scientific narrative skeletons. By providing a structured research story as an intermediate representation, Idea2Story establishes a stable foundation for downstream stages such as method development, experiment design, and paper writing.

### Idea2Story (Core Submodule of Idea2Paper)

Idea2Story introduces a pre-computation–driven framework that shifts literature understanding
from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge graph construction, enabling more efficient and
reliable autonomous scientific discovery.

### 🧠 Core Philosophy
- **Knowledge-Driven**: Uses ICLR data to build a comprehensive knowledge graph.
- **Auditable Review**: Implements an anchored multi-agent review system for objective feedback.
- **Automated Refinement**: Includes RAG deduplication and intelligent revision to enhance novelty.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🕸️ Knowledge Graph**: Built from ICLR data with Idea/Pattern/Domain/Paper nodes.
- **🎣 Advanced Retrieval**: Three-path retrieval (Idea/Domain/Paper) with two-stage ranking (Jaccard + Embedding).
- **📝 Idea2Story Generation**: From pattern selection to story generation, anchored review, and smart correction.
- **🤖 Anchored Multi-Agent Review**: Uses real review statistics as anchors for relative comparisons, producing deterministic and auditable 1-10 scores.
- **📊 Comprehensive Logging**: Per-run structured logs for full reproducibility and auditing.

## 📦 Outputs

- 📄 `Paper-KG-Pipeline/output/final_story.json`: Final structured Story (title/abstract/problem/method/contribs/experiments).
- 🔍 `Paper-KG-Pipeline/output/pipeline_result.json`: Full pipeline trace (reviews, corrections, audits).
- 📂 `log/run_.../`: Structured logs for every run.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r Paper-KG-Pipeline/requirements.txt
```
> **Note:** The embedding model is configurable via `EMBEDDING_MODEL` / `EMBEDDING_API_URL` (env or `i2p_config.json`). If you switch models, rebuild novelty/recall indexes or use model-specific index directories to avoid mismatch.  
> **Constraint:** the embedding model must output **4096-dimensional** vectors (same as `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`).  
> **Recommended (auto_profile):** set `I2P_INDEX_DIR_MODE=auto_profile` to auto-map each embedding config to its own index dirs: `Paper-KG-Pipeline/output/novelty_index__{provider}__{model}__{urlhash}` and `.../recall_index__...`.  
> Explicit `I2P_NOVELTY_INDEX_DIR` / `I2P_RECALL_INDEX_DIR` (env or `i2p_config.json`) override auto_profile.  
> **Tip (speed/stability):** set `I2P_ANCHOR_DENSIFY_ENABLE=0` to skip Adaptive Densify; otherwise Phase 3 Critic can be much slower and may fail due to strict JSON validation.  
> **Tip (debug):** if you repeatedly hit Critic JSON errors, set `I2P_CRITIC_STRICT_JSON=0` (or `critic.strict_json=false`) to disable strict mode and allow fallback.  
> **Supported (no code changes):** OpenAI-compatible Embeddings APIs (`/v1/embeddings`) that accept `input` as a string or a list (e.g., SiliconFlow, OpenAI, and other OpenAI-compatible providers).  
> **Not supported yet:** DashScope “native” embeddings endpoint (`/api/v1/services/embeddings/...`) requires an adapter.

### Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY`.
2. (Optional) Copy `i2p_config.example.json` to `i2p_config.json` to tweak settings.

### Usage

```bash
python Paper-KG-Pipeline/scripts/idea2story_pipeline.py "your research idea"
```

## 🌐 Frontend (Local Web UI)

> **Status:** The frontend is currently unstable. We recommend running the pipeline from the terminal for now. We will improve the frontend in future updates.

Run a minimal local UI to launch the pipeline and view **only** high-level stage + final results (no raw logs on screen).

### Start

```bash
python frontend/server/app.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

Open in your browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### What you can do in the UI
- Run the same pipeline entrypoint (`idea2story_pipeline.py`) from a web page.
- Configure `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY`, `LLM_API_URL`, `LLM_MODEL` for the current run (not persisted by the server).
- Toggle Novelty / Verification.
- Download the current run logs as a zip.

For more details, see `frontend/README.md`.

### Output

```text
output/
├── final_story.json # Final generated paper story
├── pipeline_result.json # Full pipeline results
└── log.json # Detailed logs
```
Check `final_story.json` for the result and `pipeline_result.json` for the full process.


## 🤖 Anchored Multi‑Agent Review

Instead of arbitrary scores, this project uses **anchored comparisons**. We select anchor papers with known scores, ask LLMs to compare your target against these anchors (better/tie/worse), and then deterministically fit a final numeric score. This ensures the review process is auditable and grounded in real-world data.
