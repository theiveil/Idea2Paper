  "title": "Autoregressive Image Diffusion via Spatio-Temporal ODE Alignment for Zero-Shot MRI Reconstruction",
  "abstract": "We propose the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model to address the critical challenge of sampling high-fidelity posteriors in accelerated MRI reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that treat slices independently or rely purely on discrete sequential conditioning, we reframe this task as a Manifold Alignment challenge. Our approach aligns the generic visual manifold of pre-trained diffusion priors with the physical measurement manifold of k-space data through a unified dynamic system. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal ODE Alignment framework that treats anatomical sequence continuity as a geometric constraint, allowing the 'noise time' of diffusion and the 'spatial sequence' of MRI stacks to co-evolve. By implementing a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) to solve this coupled system, we transform the reconstruction process into a high-precision numerical integration. This enables zero-shot volumetric reconstruction that maintains structural coherence and rigorous physical consistency without requiring sequence-specific training.",
  "problem_framing": "We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a sequential slice generation task or a single inverse problem to a **manifold alignment challenge**. The core problem is bridging the gap between the semantic manifold of generic image priors and the constraint manifold of k-space measurements. This requires synchronizing the 'time' dimension of diffusion with the 'space' dimension of anatomical sequences under a unified dynamic system. We posit that the latent space of generic diffusion priors contains sufficient dynamic information to model anatomical continuity, allowing us to treat the pseudo-inverse sequence and the generic denoising trajectory as topologically isomorphic structures.",
  "gap_pattern": "Existing diffusion-based MRI methods fail to achieve this alignment because they treat inter-slice dependencies as discrete conditioning steps rather than continuous geometric constraints. Standard autoregressive models generate slices sequentially, ignoring the topological isomorphism between the pseudo-inverse trajectory and the generic denoising path. Furthermore, current approaches lack the rigorous numerical integration required to solve the coupled system of denoising and physical consistency. They struggle to balance the high fidelity needed for medical imaging with the speed required for clinical workflows, often sacrificing temporal coherence for fast individual sampling due to the prohibitive computational cost of sequential generation.",
  "solution": "We introduce **Manifold-Aligned Autoregressive Image Diffusion**, a framework that transforms MRI reconstruction into a Spatio-Temporal ODE Alignment process. By treating anatomical sequence continuity as a geometric constraint on the diffusion trajectory, we unify physical consistency and anatomical consistency into a single co-evolutionary manifold alignment process. We employ a modified score network parameterization that supports deterministic sampling across the sequence. Crucially, we utilize a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) to solve the inter-slice coherence ODE concurrently with the diffusion denoising ODE. This technical choice transforms the slow, stochastic autoregressive generation into a fast, high-precision numerical integration, allowing us to sample the full posterior distribution of MRI sequences with significantly fewer function evaluations while maintaining structural coherence.",
  "method_skeleton": "Step 1: Formulate the reconstruction as a co-evolutionary system where the diffusion score function and the k-space measurement manifold are aligned via a unified Spatio-Temporal ODE, treating the slice index as a continuous variable in the generative process; Step 2: Implement a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) to discretize this coupled ODE, leveraging the semilinear structure of diffusion processes to minimize discretization error in both denoising time and anatomical space; Step 3: Apply a quasi-Taylor scheme with ideal derivative substitution to approximate higher-order gradients of the manifold alignment, enabling efficient zero-shot posterior sampling without task-specific training.",

  "experiments_plan": "We evaluate our method on the FastMRI and IXI knee/brain datasets to ensure generalizability beyond a single domain. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art methods including standard autoregressive models (e.g., Video Diffusion Models), physics-informed diffusion models (e.g., CSDI), and unrolled optimization networks (e.g., VarNet). Metrics include PSNR, SSIM, and HFEN for image quality, along with temporal coherence metrics for sequence consistency. We conduct ablation studies on the ODE alignment term and the DEIS solver steps. Additionally, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for the coupled Spatio-Temporal ODE system to address theoretical concerns."
