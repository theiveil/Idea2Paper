  "title": "Autoregressive Image Diffusion for Efficient Posterior Sampling in Accelerated MRI Reconstruction",
  "abstract": "Accelerated MRI reconstruction requires sampling from complex posterior distributions to recover high-fidelity images from undersampled k-space data. We propose the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model, a novel framework designed to leverage the strengths of diffusion models for image sequence generation within the context of MRI reconstruction. To address the critical challenge of computational latency, we integrate advanced numerical integration techniques that transform the traditionally slow diffusion sampling process into a highly efficient operation. By utilizing a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS), our approach minimizes discretization errors and significantly reduces the number of required function evaluations. This allows AID to perform rapid posterior sampling while maintaining the structural coherence essential for medical imaging. Our results demonstrate that AID achieves superior reconstruction quality and speed compared to existing methods, establishing a new paradigm for efficient, high-fidelity MRI reconstruction.",
  "problem_framing": "We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a static inverse optimization problem into a dynamic sequence generation task governed by Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID). Traditional methods often view MRI recovery as a one-time mapping, ignoring the sequential dependencies inherent in high-dimensional data distributions. By transforming the reconstruction process into an autoregressive generative modeling problem, we can capture complex spatial correlations and uncertainties in the posterior distribution. However, this shift introduces the challenge of generating coherent image sequences efficiently, requiring a fundamental rethinking of how we approach sampling in the context of medical imaging physics.",
  "gap_pattern": "Current approaches for MRI reconstruction using generative models fail to effectively balance the computational demands of sequential sampling with the need for high diagnostic fidelity. Existing diffusion-based methods are limited by isotropic diffusion assumptions and require prohibitively slow sampling processes, involving hundreds to thousands of neural network evaluations. This inefficiency prevents their practical application in clinical settings where speed is paramount. Furthermore, these methods lack the specialized mechanisms to handle the autoregressive nature of image sequence generation, resulting in artifacts and inconsistencies when sampling from complex posteriors in accelerated MRI scenarios.",
  "solution": "We introduce the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model to address the dual challenges of posterior sampling fidelity and computational efficiency in MRI reconstruction. Our solution leverages the semilinear structure of diffusion processes to implement a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS), which serves as the engine for rapid image sequence generation. By reframing the sampling trajectory as a numerical integration problem, we employ exponential integrators to drastically reduce discretization errors with fewer steps. Additionally, we modify the score network parameterization to support deterministic sampling within the autoregressive framework, ensuring stability and consistency across the generated sequence. This architecture not only accelerates the reconstruction process but also enhances the quality of the sampled posterior by effectively utilizing the temporal dependencies inherent in the AID model.",
